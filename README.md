verilog files for iCE40HX8K Breakout Board, build with IceStorm.
These files are designed to be used with verilog tutorials
see bottom-left here:

https://embeddedmicro.com/tutorials/mojo/creating-a-project

Install IceStorm: http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/peepo/verilog_tutorials_BB
    
Download [user guide](http://www.latticesemi.com/~/media/LatticeSemi/Documents/UserManuals/EI/EB85.pdf?document_id=50373)

    read pages 5-6
    NB: make upload uses -S to program SRAM so please remove J7 jumper and rotate 2xJ6 jumpers

Build one of the examples:

    cd project
    make
    make upload

|2|Sync Logic|LED blink|1Hz|
|3|PWM1|LEDs fade|4x, 6x with clk_50 from divider
|4|PWM2|LEDs clk |8 LEDs fade in and out together ~1.5hz ?anomalous
|5|PWM3|LEDs wave|8 LEDs fade in and out in sequence 12MHz
|5_PLL|PWM4|LEDs PLL|8 LEDs fade in and out in sequence 25/48/96MHz
|6|_tb1|testbench|basic and 
|7|_tb2|testbench clk|pwm for a couple of values
|8|ext button|ext button|6,800Î© connects +ive to input and switch, -ive to other end
|9|metastability|ext button|with debounce
|10|PWM5|servo|arm swings through range: red-TP1 brown-TP3 orange-P16
|10_vga|colour|VGA PLL| display bars 640x480
||Hello World|AVR|rely on AVR microcontroller in mojo, PIC is competitor
||----|--|mimas, XuLA2 have PIC18F14K50, 
||SPI-|--|logipi may not have microcontroller? has spansion flash
||LogiCore|RAM|no project...
|17|Timing|12Mhz|Total path delay: 84.10 ns (11.89 MHz)?
|18|Timing_pipeline|12Mhz|Total path delay: 37.28 ns (26.83 MHz)
|19|FSM |LEDs 2x|left_PWM & right_PWM, maybe also 5x states, ie forward....
||Memory mapping|AVR|ibid
||SDRAM|N/A|MimasV2possibly or XuLA2 SDRAM before writing to SDcard
||Embedded processor|N/A|skipping for moment.
