	verilog files for iCE40HX8K Breakout Board, build with IceStorm.
	These files are designed to be used with verilog tutorials
	see bottom-left here:
	
https://embeddedmicro.com/tutorials/mojo/creating-a-project

Install IceStorm: http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/

Install necessary tools:

    sudo apt-get install git cmake 

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/peepo/verilog_tutorials_BB

Build one of the examples:

    cd project
    make
    make upload

NB: make upload uses -S to program SRAM so please remove J7 jumper and rotate 2xJ6 jumpers


Project

	0	LED
	00	LED with +out
	000	switch tbc
	1	button					button
	2	Sync Logic				LED blink	1Hz
	3	PWM1					LEDs fade	4x, 6x with clk_50 from divider
	4	PWM2					LEDs animate 	8 LEDs fade in and out together ~1.5hz timing seems anomalous
	5	PWM3					LEDs wave	8 LEDs fade in and out in sequence
	5_PLL	PWM4					LEDs wave	8 LEDs fade in and out faster in sequence using PLL 25/48/96MHz
	6	_tb1					testbench and	basic and 
	7	_tb2					testbench clk	pwm for a couple of values
	8	ext button				ext button	6,800Î© connects + to input and switch, negative to other end switch
	9	metastability				ext button	with debounce
	10	PWM5					servo		arm swings through range: red-TP1 brown-TP3 orange-P16
		Hello World				AVR		rely on AVR microcontroller in mojo, PIC is competitor
		----					--		mimas, XuLA2 have PIC18F14K50, 
		SPI-					--		logipi may not have microcontroller? has spansion flash
		LogiCore				RAM		no project...
	17	Timing					100Mhz		builds with expected timing errors : odd that when run @50Mhz no errors?
	18	Timing_pipeline				100Mhz		builds with no timing errors due to pipeline
	19	FSM					LEDs 2x		left_PWM & right_PWM, maybe also 5x states, ie forward....
		Mem. map				AVR		ibid
		SDRAM					N/A		MimasV2	possibly or XuLA2 SDRAM before writing to SDcard
		Em.proc					N/A		skipping for moment.

when cmake is implemented:

Build one of the examples:

    cd verilog_tutorials_BB/build
    cmake ..
    cd project_0/
    make
    ./LED

Build all examples (takes a while):

    cd verilog_tutorials_BB/build
    cmake ..
    make
